# Mouse button remote-controlled using Python

A very simple project that maps buttons in a web page to your mouse input.

You only need to install Python 3.7+ and its requirements.

`Linux: python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

`Windows: py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
 
 ### Use
 
 Execute the main.py file and go to http://<your_pc_ip> in your smartphone.
 
 The default port is 80. In linux you can't start a server in ports below 1024 without sudo. Just execute with sudo or change the port in the app.run (recommended).
 
 In Windows, you may need to open the port in the Firewall. Just execute wf.msc and add a rule.
